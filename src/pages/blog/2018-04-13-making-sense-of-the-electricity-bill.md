The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) is responsible for lighting up our homes in nepal. Loadshedding may come and go but NEA will always send someone to check up in our houses once a month. He or she will read your meter and leave a bill for you, your monthly electricity bill or bijli bill.

While most people just don't care of understanding the bill. We were asked to explain how to make sense of this bill. We’ll explain how the bill is generated, how meter reading is done.

## How to read the bill

Present RDG refers to the units read by the meter checker at the date of check. Similarly previous RDD refers to the reading of the previous month. the difference is the total billable units.

Here in this example bill,
PRESENT RDG = 46526
PREVIOUS RDG = 46451
UNITS = 75

Next thing you need to see in the bill is the the Current rating of your meter. Mine is 5A "DOMESTIC(5A)". Behind the bill you will find the Rate table.

## Calculation

### Minimum/Service charge = 100

This value corresponds to न्यूनतम शुल्क column against the row in which the total units used falls in the first column.

### Calculation of rest amount

| KWH Monthly | Rate | Units | Total |
| ----------- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| 0-20        | 3    | 20    | 60    |
| 21-30       | 7    | 10    | 70    |
| 31-50       | 8.5  | 20    | 170   |
| 51-150      | 10   | 25    | 250   |
| Grand Total |      |       | 550   |

Here I don't have to go further as My total units spent has been covered.

Hence,
Total Bill = Minimum Charge + Total by rate = 100 + 550 = Rs. 650.
